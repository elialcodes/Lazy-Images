This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started :book: :blush: :pencil: :star:

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More ðŸ“š

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Typescript exercises 


This repository is about some exercises made by myself to study Typescript. It contains examples and comments to understand the code. Maybe it can help someone.


## Features 

- it is divided into different .ts files and their corresponding compiled .js files.
- there are examples with primitive data (numbers, strings, bolleans, arrays)
- there are examples with special data (any, union types, literal types, functions, return functions, objects...)

 
## Tech Stack 

Typescritp, Javascript and Node js.
  

## Installation ðŸ’» 

- Clone the repository: https://github.com/elialcodes/Typescript-exercises.git
- Install Node.js
- Install node_modules folder: 

```bash
  npm install
```

- Run the code: 

```bash
  npx tsc
```

- For continuous synchronization between .ts files and .js files:
